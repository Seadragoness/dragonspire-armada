    <details>
        <summary>13. Activity of Tier 1-2 wolves</summary>
        <p>Ideally, tier 1-2 wolves should be posted 2-3 times per month to maintain consistency without overwhelming a single person. However, I would like to see some months with at least 5-6 posts periodically to demonstrate sustained effort and engagement.</p>
